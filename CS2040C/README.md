## CS2040C Data Structures and Algorithms

**AY20/21 SEM 2, taught by Prof. Ho-lun Cheng, Alan.**

A great module that introduces students to the design and implementation of 
data structures and algorithms. Topics included in this module are linked list, 
searching and sorting algorithms, abstract data type, trees, heap, union-find, 
hash table, graphs, minimum spanning trees, convex hull, etc.

CS2040C is one of the most useful programming module in NUS. It was conducted 
on [Coursemology](https://coursemology.org/). The lecture videos were recorded 
and uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). Please feel free to 
contact me if you wish to access the videos.

This folder contains all the assignments that I have done, but they are by no 
means the "model answers". I have also included two cheatsheets (credit to 
[Xianhao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xianhao/)) that I used extensively 
during my studies. Please use this folder as references and **NOT** as easy 
solutions to the assignments. I will remove this folder from my repository if 
requested by NUS.
