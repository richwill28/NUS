## CS2040C Data Structures and Algorithms

**AY20/21 SEM 2, taught by Prof. Ho-lun Cheng, Alan & Prof. Steven Halim.**

A great module that introduces students to the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms. Topics included in this module are linked list, searching and sorting algorithms, abstract data type, trees, heap, union-find, hash table, graphs, minimum spanning trees, convex hull, etc.

CS2040C was taught in C++, and is one of the most useful module in NUS. However, one downside from this module is the fact that there was little programming involved, and C++ STL was not discussed at all. If you are keen on exploring about C++ STL rather than focusing more on the theory/design, then Prof. Steven Halim's iteration of CS2040C might be better for you.

The lecture videos were recorded and uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). Feel free to contact me if you wish to access the videos.

This folder contains all the assignments that I have done, but they are by no means the *model answers*. I have also included two cheatsheets (credit to [Xianhao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xianhao/)) that I used extensively during my studies. Please use this folder as references and **NOT** as easy solutions to the assignments. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
