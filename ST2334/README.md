## ST2334 Probability and Statistics

**AY21/22 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Chan Yiu Man & Prof. Li Jialiang**

Topics include basic concepts of probability, conditional probability, independence, random variables, joint and marginal distributions, mean and variance, some common probability distributions, sampling distributions, estimation and hypothesis testing based on a normal population.

If you have learned A-Level math before, ST2334 will be managable. If you are an international student (like me) who have no prior experience learning statistics, then this module will be very difficult.

There are 4 quizzes (worth 30% in total) each with 10 questions and time limit of 30 minutes. Some of the questions were tricky and taxing, so 30 minutes was pretty challenging. The final exam (worth 70%) consists of 35 questions arranged into 4 sections. The number of questions in section 1, 2, 3 and 4 are respectively 12, 10, 8 and 5. Questions within a section are of similar difficulty. The section gets progressively harder. You are not allowed to return to previous sections after you move to the next section (what a bs rule!). Personally, the final exam for this semester was surprisingly easy (RIP bell curve?).

Overall, ST2334 felt like a lazy module (for the lack of a better word). Lectures are pre-recorded but they were of low video and audio quality. I find it more productive to just read the lecture slides and skip all lecture videos altogether. There were live lectures every week, but they only covered complementary stuffs from the course material. Should you skip the live lecture? I'd say it depends on your lecturer. My lecturer had a very dry delivery, so I skipped all of them. Fortunately, I've heard from others that some classes are quite engaging.

Also, the lecture slides on Chapter 5 to Chapter 7 are basically just infodumping. A lot of formulas were given with no intuitive explanations and justifications or proofs whatsoever. The recommended textbooks are not helpful with regard to this as well.

This folder contains the cheatsheet that I made for the final exam. Other important documents shared from the module folder are provided here as well for convenience. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
