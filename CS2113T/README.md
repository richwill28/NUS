## CS2113T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming

**AY21/22 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Akshay Narayan.**

This module introduces students to the systematic and rigorous development of software systems. It covers requirements, design, implementation, quality assurance, and project management aspects of small-to-medium size multi-person software projects. The module covers Object Oriented Programming Paradigm with Java.

Unfortunately, CS2113T does not cover as much depth as CS2030S in terms of OOP.
It is also much easier and has significantly less content compared with
CS2103T. In my opinion, it is better for one to take CS2030S + CS2103T, rather
than CS2113T only. Sadly, CEG students are automatically allocated to CS2113T
due to the core modules requirement.

This folder contains all the weekly exercises that I have done, but they are by
no means the "model answers". Please use this folder as references and **NOT**
as easy solutions to the exercises. I will remove this folder from my
repository if requested by NUS.
