## CS2040S Data Structures and Algorithms

**AY20/21 SEM 2, taught by Prof. Seth Lewis Gilbert & Prof. Ben Leong.**

A great module that introduces students to the design and implementation of
data structures and algorithms. Topics included in this module are linked list,
searching and sorting algorithms, abstract data type, trees, hash, graphs, minimum spanning trees, dynamic programming, etc.

CS2040S was taught in Java, and is one of the most useful module in NUS. As a
CEG student, I didn't take this module. In terms of content, however, it is
similar to CS2040C, with some differences in the topics.
