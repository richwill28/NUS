## CS2106 Introduction to Operating Systems

**AY21/22 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Li Jialin & Prof. Cristina Carbunaru**

This module introduces the basic concepts in operating systems and links it with contemporary operating systems (e.g. Unix/Linux and Windows).

CEG students are not allowed to take this module and we have to take CG2271 instead. However, the content of CG2271 is very different as it focuses more on embedded systems, or so I've heard. Fortunately, I was given the opportunity to audit this module, but I didn't realize that CS2100 is a prerequisite (again, CEG students have to take CG2028 instead), so the content of CS2106 was quite tough for me to follow.

This folder contains all the lab assignments that I have done, but they are by no means the *model answers*. Please use this folder as references and **NOT** as easy solutions to the assignments. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
