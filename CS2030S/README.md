## CS2030S Programming Methodology II

**AY20/21 SEM 2, taught by Prof. Ooi Wei Tsang.**

A great module that explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented 
programming and functional programming. This module was taught in Java, but it 
is not about learning how to code in Java. It teaches students how to write 
"good" code (e.g., readable, understandable, flexible, scalable, etc.). Topics 
included in this module are encapsulation, composition, inheritance, 
polymorphism, abstract class, interface, generics, wildcards, immutability, 
lazy evaluation, stream, monad, asynchronous programming, etc. For more 
information, visit the [course website](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2021-s2/).

CS2030S is not a core module for CEG students (and I still couldn't believe 
this!), hence I didn't take this module. However, I regret not taking this 
module as it is undoubtedly one of the best programming module in NUS. The 
content of CS2030S is very useful and I recommend every student to take it if 
possible, but do keep in mind that the workload is quite high.

This folder contains all the lab assignments that I attempted by myself without 
any grading, so they are by no means the "model answers". Please use this 
folder as references and **NOT** as easy solutions to the assignments. I will 
remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
