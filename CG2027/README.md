## CG2027 Transistor-level Digital Circuits

**AY21/22 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Kelvin Fong.**

The content of this module is divided into five main topics, namely semiconductor device, CMOS inverter, CMOS logic, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and memory.

CG2027 suffers a lot from being a 2 MC half-semester module. A lot of topics covered lack clarity, depth, and rigor. In the end, you will get a taste of how transistor works, without really understanding the underlying physics, the nitty-gritty details of how everything operates at a lower level, and how everything fits into the bigger picture. From the practicality point of view, I have to say that this module is close to useless, unfortunately.

This folder contains a cheatsheet that I have written (.tex file coming soon!). There were five weekly assignments but the they are reused every semester, so I will not upload them here. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
