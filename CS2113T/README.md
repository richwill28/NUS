## CS2113T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming

**AY21/22 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Akshay Narayan.**

This module introduces students to the systematic and rigorous development of software systems. It covers requirements, design, implementation, quality assurance, and project management aspects of small-to-medium size multi-person software projects. CS2113T also covers Object Oriented Programming paradigm with Java. For more information, visit the [course website](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/website/).

The main graded components from this module are the iP (individual project) and the tP (team project). On the one hand, the iP is graded based on implementation, documentation, and project management. On the other hand, the tP is graded based on design, implementation, documentation, quality assurance, and project management. You can visit [my iP](https://github.com/richwill28/ip) and my team's tP to find out more.

Unfortunately, CS2113T does not cover as much depth as CS2030S in terms of OOP. It is also much easier and has significantly less content compared with CS2103T. In my opinion, it is better for one to take CS2030S + CS2103T, rather than CS2113T only. Sadly, CEG students are automatically allocated to CS2113T due to the core modules requirement.

This folder contains all the weekly exercises that I have done, but they are by no means the *model answers*. Please use this folder as references and **NOT** as easy solutions to the exercises. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
