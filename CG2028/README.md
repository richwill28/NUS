## CG2028 Computer Organization

**AY21/22 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Henry Tan & Prof. Rajesh Panicker.**

The topics covered in this module are Microprocessor Concepts, ARM Instruction Sets, Single Cycle Processor Design, Cache Memory Principle, and Pipelining Basics.

CG2028 is a very short module on Computer Organization. Each lecture is 3 hours and it is way too long and unnecessary. Tutorial, on the other hand, is 1 hour and it felt rushed as the contents were comprehensive. The final exam (worth 50%) was a combination of MCQs, short and long questions. It should be managable given sufficient knowledge of the course material.

Lab sessions are useless (basically you meet your teammate on Zoom for 3 hours, no content or activity whatsoever). The lab assignment (worth 50%) is a pair work consisted of designing an assembly language solution to a given problem. It was quite disappointing as the assigment was pretty much a toy program that can be solved in under 2 hours. Machine codes corresponding to the assembly instructions are to be provided as part of the assignment, though I'm pretty sure nobody from the grading team would be bothered to check them. We also need to submit a paper design showing how the microarchitecture (datapath and control unit) covered in Lecture 4 can be modified to support both `MUL` and `MLA` instruction. It should be doable if you understand the content of the lecture, though admittedly I was not excited at all and only started doing the design 2 hours before the submission deadline (don't do this!). Consequently, the assignment report that I attached here definitely contains some mistakes.

One more point worth noting is that different GAs graded different teams during the evaluation. From my experience, however, I suspect that the GA that were evaluating my team was not competent enough. I won't share too much details here but basically, the GA did not seem to understand some of the things that we put in our assembly code (albeit they were standard industry practices). Overall, you will definitely learn something new from this module, but don't expect too much. CG2028 has a lot of potential if it is a 4 MC module, where most topics can be treated more comprehensively and more advanced topics can be introduced.

This folder contains a cheatsheet that I made for the final exam. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
