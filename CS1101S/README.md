## CS1101S Programming Methodology

**AY20/21 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Martin Henz & Prof. Low Kok Lim.**

The content of this module is based on [SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) but adapted to JavaScript. The topics are divided into 4 main sections, namely functions (abstraction, recursion, higher-order, substitution model), data (pairs, lists, trees), state (mutation, loops and arrays, environment model), and beyond (streams, meta-circular evaluator).

I'm currently reading this module by myself, and I have to say, even as a Year 2 CEG student I am pleasantly surprised as I still managed learn something new from this module. CS1101S is different from your conventional introductory course in Computer Science like CS1010. CS1010 (taught by Prof. Ooi Wei Tsang) is a great module, don't get me wrong. However, CS1101S is just built different, it focuses on functional programming and it doesn't even introduce loops until half of the semester. This module is just very well-designed and is definitely one of the best module in NUS. Dare I say that because of this module, I wish to rewind time and just major in CS instead of CEG.

This folder contains all the codes that I have written for this module. Please use this folder as references and **NOT** as easy solutions to any of the assignments. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
