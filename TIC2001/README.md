## TIC2001 Data Structures and Algorithms

**AY21/22 SEM 1, taught by Prof. Ho-lun Cheng, Alan.**

I am a teaching assistant for TIC2001 in AY21/22 SEM 1. In terms of content, TIC2001 = CS2040C - convex hull. Overall quality remains the same, refer to [my review on CS2040C](https://github.com/richwill28/NUS-Resources/tree/main/CS2040C) for more details.

All the assignments are the same as CS2040C, so I will not reupload them here. This folder contains my attempt at doing the PE, and it is by no means the *model answer*. Please use this folder as references and **NOT** as easy solutions. I will remove this folder from my repository if requested by NUS.
