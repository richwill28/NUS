We found the binary executable for `mastermind`.  It appears that your code compiles without errors.

Your `mastermind` passes all test cases. :thumbsup:

Your `mastermind` does not seem to have any memory leak.  Great!

Your `mmnull` crashes if memory allocation on the heap fails.  There is a -1 penalty for failing to guard against memory allocation failure.  Please remember to check for NULL.

`clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `mastermind.c`.  No warnings are generated.  :confetti_ball:

No documentation-related warnings are generated.
